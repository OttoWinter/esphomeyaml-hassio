# esphomeyaml HassIO add-on (beta)

This is the repository from which you can install a beta version of the
esphomeyaml HassIO dashboard. An out-of-beta version of this add-on will hopefully soon be released. But right now it probably still has tons of bugs in the front-end code that still need to be fixed.

You can install this add-on by using this URL as an HassIO add-on repository:

```

```

I'm not a web-developer (nor do I ever plan to be after this fun experience); there are a few problems that I already know about. Namely: the log output not automatically scrolling and the whole dashboard looking ridiculous on mobile.

The source code for this Add-On can be found [here](https://github.com/OttoWinter/esphomeyaml/tree/master/esphomeyaml/hassio). If you find an issue, please report it - unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to fix most of them, as I simply don't have the experience. So a PR fixing the issue would be absolutely *amazing* :P Thanks!
